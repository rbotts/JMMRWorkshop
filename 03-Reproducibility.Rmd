## R, RStudio, and RMarkdown

One of the benefits of using R is that is comes with its own documentation system, called RMarkdown.  The distinction between R, RStudio, and RMarkdown is often blurred, but in there is a difference:  

- R is a programming language  
- RStudio is a writing software and GUI for using R    
- RMarkdown an authoring format for communication  

At the root of everything is the R programming language, but RStudio and RMarkdown layer on additional interfaces and languages to support reproducibility of results and communication.

## Communication with RMarkdown

The Markdown language has actually been around for a while.  It is a markup language with plain text formatting syntax that allows it to be converted to many output formats, such as HTML.  RMarkdown adapts the Markdown language and incorporates the ability to include R code and output (and other languages) seamlessly.  The beauty of R Markdown is that it allows you to create reproducible reports of analysis, without copy and pasting code/output, and to export those reports into HTML, Word .docx, and PDF.

2. Download the following document and save it into your Project folder: [Introduction to R.Rmd](Practice Notebooks/JMMPractice-Introduction_to_Rmarkdown.Rmd)  
3. Check settings (gear) that is says “Preview in Viewer Pane”  ![](Images/PreviewPane.png)
4. To see the output of the document, click Preview, What happened?
