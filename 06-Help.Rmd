# Teaching students (and you) how to get help

We just practiced one of the most challenging aspects for students:  debugging errors!  Here are some more ways to get help:

Searching for help:

* Using ```??```
* Using ```?```
* ```browseVignettes()```
* Search for a descriptions of the task, not your specific case (students have to be reminded of this)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [RSeek.org](https://rseek.org/)

One of the wonderful things about R is all of the publicly available support.  There are nearly limitless places to go.  Here are a few links that we find helpful.

* [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
* [ggplot Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [R Graphics Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)
